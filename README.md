# OneMoreRepFitness

This is an open source project to create a Fittness app. The idea is that training should be simple. Many of the fittness applications
out there are very complicated with alot of settings and menus. The basis of the app is that it should be easy to use. You open the app,
select a workout and start training.

- I appreciate contributions and ideas in any form. At the moment the application is very basic, there is functionality for loading the
  workouts, saving and retrieving results via Firebase.
